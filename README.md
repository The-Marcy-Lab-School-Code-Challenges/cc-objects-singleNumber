# Code Challenge: PEDAC Practice 

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in VScode. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

**1.** Given a non-empty array of numbers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single number and return it. Implement a function `singleNumber()` with a **linear runtime complexity.**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
