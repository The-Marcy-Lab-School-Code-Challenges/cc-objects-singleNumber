# Code Challenge: Strings

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in VScode. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems


1. Declare a function named `averageInArray` that will calculate the average of the elements in an array of numbers rounded to the nearest decimal. The function returns a string showing the calulations for getting that average. You must solve this without using any built-in array methods by iterating through the array.  
```
averageInArray([2,4,5,7,8]) // returns "26 divided by 5 calculates an average of 5.2"
averageInArray([2,2,5,10]) // returns "19 divided by 4 calculates an average of 4.8"
averageInArray([2,2,2,2,2,2,2]) // returns "14 divided by 7 calculates an average of 2"
```
